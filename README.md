# Python OOP Restaurant Model

A Python project focused on object-oriented modeling of a restaurant business
structure and class relationships.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how object-oriented design can be used to model a
simple restaurant business domain. It focuses on clean class structure,
composition, and readable method behavior rather than production features.

The system models:
- Menus with items and prices
- Restaurant franchises with time-based menu availability
- A business composed of multiple franchises

## Project Structure

├── models.py   # Core class definitions

├── demo.py     # Example usage and execution

└── README.md   # Project documentation

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation and separation of responsibilities
- Composition (Business → Franchise → Menu)
- Dictionary-based data modeling
- Clear method interfaces and object representations

## How to Run

Run the demo script:

python demo.py

This will create menu objects, franchises, and businesses, and print example
outputs to the console.

## Scope

This project is intended as a focused demonstration of object-oriented design
principles in Python. It is not a production-ready system and does not include
persistence, authentication, or user interfaces.
